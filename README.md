# Qiskit Hackathon Bilbao 2019

## Things to do before the hackathon

Check the [`preparation&installation`](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask a coacher in the channel `#qiskit-hackathon-bilbao` (qiskit.slack.com) to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
