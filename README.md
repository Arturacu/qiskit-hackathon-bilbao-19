# Qiskit Hackathon Bilbao 2019

## Challenge

*Quantum Finance: Pricing Financial derivatives using IBMQX*: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-hackathon-bilbao-19/issues/12
    

## What's this about?

Pricing interest-rate financial derivatives, as a major problem, needs an approach to accurately reproduce the time-evolution of interest rates.
Original solution, on https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05803, is reproduced here.
